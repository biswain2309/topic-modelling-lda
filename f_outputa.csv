Abstract
Chloroquine and closely related structural analogs, employed 
initially for the treatment of malaria, are now gaining 
worldwide attention due to the rapidly spreading pandemic 
caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2, 
named coronavirus disease (COVID) of 2019 (COVID-19). 
Although much of this attention has a mechanistic basis, 
the hard e˜cacy data for chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine 
in the management of the clinical syndrome of COVID-19 
have been limited thus far. This review aims to present the 
available 
in vitro
 and clinical data for the role of chloroquine/
hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 and attempts to put them 
into perspective, especially in relation to the di˚erent 
risks/bene˛ts particular to each patient who may require 
treatment.

Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the context of COVID-19
Chloroquine and related drugs were initially developed as 
antimalarial agents. During the Second World War, many 
clinicians made serendipitous observations that these 
drugs could be bene˛cial for treating rheumatological 
and dermatological conditions.
1Œ3
 Since then, several 
well-designed studies have established their e˜cacy in 
the chronic management of connective tissue disorders, 
including systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid 
arthritis,
4 and there has been a growing list of indications 
to support their therapeutic potential in varied diseases of 
oncology, cardiology, and nephrology.
1 These agents have 
also shown a promising role in viral infections, and with 
the recent declaration on March 12th, 2020, by the World 
Health Organization that coronavirus disease (COVID) of 
2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic, these compounds have 
rapidly gained worldwide attention for their ability to control 
the causative virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome-
coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). In this narrative review, the 
authors discuss these medications from a mechanistic 
perspective with speci˛c insights into their potential role 
in controlling viral infections. We discuss 
in vitro
 and 
in vivo
 evidence for their emerging therapeutic role in COVID-19 with 
due concerns to safety when applying the known facts to 
large populations increasingly a˚ected with COVID-19.
Mechanistic rationale
Both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are weak 
bases that exist in the extracellular environment mostly 
in a protonated form with a positive charge. This positive 
charge makes them incapable of crossing the plasma 
membrane. The non-protonated portion that enters a 
cell is quickly protonated and concentrated in the acidic, 
low-pH organelles such as endosomes, Golgi vesicles, and 
lysosomes.
5 The antimalarial actions of these compounds are 
related to a heavy accumulation of these drugs in the acidic 
lysosomes of the parasites, which leads to a neutralizing, 
‚lysosomotropic™ e˚ect that prevents the detoxi˛cation of 
ingested ‚heme™ moiety, resulting in lysis of the malarial 
parasite.
1 Additionally, investigators have identi˛ed a series of 
immunomodulatory and anti-in˝ammatory e˚ects for these 
agents.
1 These include inhibition of ligand-based toll-like 
receptor stimulation, inhibition of nuclear factor kappa-
light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFkB) pathways 
in macrophages with resultant reduction in the generation 
of pro-in˝ammatory cytokines, reduced processing of the 
endogenous and exogenous ligands through lysosomes 
and endosomes with resultant reduction in the availability 
of processed antigens for presentation to the major

histocompatibility complexŒT cell receptor interactions, and 
downstream activation of cellular immunity.
6Œ9
 Together, 
these properties lay the foundation of their use in several 
rheumatological, cardiovascular, and dermatological diseases. 
These pleiotropic actions, seen in a variety of chronic diseases, 
have also guided their exploration for the control of viral 
infections. To date, these agents have been explored in 
Ebola virus disease,
10
 human immunode˛ciency virus (HIV) 
infection,
11,12
 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS),
13 and 
SARS-CoV-1 infection,
5,14
 and their promising action against 
SARS-CoV-1 has provided the basis for their putative bene˛ts in 
treating SARS-CoV-2 infection.
15 However, the exact mechanism 
by which chloroquine/HCQ may be of bene˛t in COVID-19 is 
largely speculative and appears to be related to a series of 
actions demonstrated in alternate, yet similar, disease models 
(Figure 1). 
HCQ is known to have signi˛cant e˚ects on many mechanisms 
that drive the viral entry into the host cells. Most prominent 
among them are its actions on the angiotensin converting 
enzyme (ACE) II receptors. The original experiments during 
the SARS epidemic suggested that SARS-CoV-1 binds 
to ACE II receptors, primarily present in the lung, heart, 
kidney, and intestine for its entry into the host system. More 
speci˛cally, SARS-CoV-1 binds to the sialic acid moiety of the 
ACE II receptors.
15,16
 Chloroquine inhibits the intracellular 
glycosylation of the ACE II, and thus inhibits the addition 
of sialic acid moiety, which then leads to reduced ligand 
recognition and internalization of the virus.
17
 Phylogenetic 
analysis of SARS-CoV-2 has shown about 80% nucleotide 
homology with SARS-CoV-1,
18 prompting the evaluation of 
these drug compounds for COVID-19. Once the virus is bound 
to the cell membrane, endosomes play an important role in 
the fusion of viral particles and their internalization. Thus, 
neutralization of the acidic pH of the endosome by chloroquine 
or HCQ may prevent the fusion of SARS-CoV-2 with the host cell 
inhibiting the primary entry.
19
 An alternate mechanism hypothesized to inhibit the uptake of 
the virus into the host cell is based on the ability of chloroquine 
to be a broad inhibitor of nanoparticle endocytosis by 
resident macrophages.
20 At the concentrations achieved 
in routine clinical dosing, chloroquine reduces 
in vitro
 and 
in vivo
 accumulation of synthetic nanoparticles.
21,22
 It also 
reduces the expression of phosphatidylinositol-binding 
clathrin assembly protein,
22 required for clathrin-mediated 
endocytosis of nano-sized structures. The ultrastructural 
studies of SARS-CoV-2 show that these virions fall within the 
same size (60Œ140 nm) and shape (spherical) range
18 as the 
commonly studied synthetic nanoparticles.
23,24
 Thus, these 
actions against SARS-CoV-2 may be applicable at early stages 
before viral replication,
20 which requires further experimental 
con˛rmation. Alternatively, these compounds may act at later 
stages by inhibiting speci˛c enzymes needed for assembly 
of virion and budding of the virions from the cell membrane. 
These drugs may accomplish these goals without disruption 
of the viral particle and liberation of viral nucleic acid and 
enzymes that are necessary for viral replication from a 
lysosome.
25,26
Finally, these compounds have been shown to have a profound 
e˚ect on the in˝ammatory cascade. SARS-CoV, through its ACE 
II receptor attachment, infects the type 2 pneumocytes in the 
alveolar epithelium. This results in a local in˝ammatory reaction 
with resident neutrophils and macrophage activation as well as 
activation of the cellular immunity arm with T helper 1 (Th1)-
type response. The resultant cytokine storm and alteration 
in epithelial permeability lead to the development of acute 
respiratory distress syndrome and associated morbidity and 
mortality related to COVID-19.
5 Chloroquine/HCQ reduces the 
secretion of the proin˝ammatory cytokines, in particular the 
Th1 cytokines, namely interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6 tumor necrosis 
factor-˙ (TNF˙), and interferon-gamma (IFNˆ),
27 by the alveolar 
macrophages, and thus may have a role in reducing the peak 
in˝ammatory response in COVID-19. These antiviral e˚ects

combined with immunomodulatory properties are promising, 
and thus over the last 3 months, multiple studies have been 
launched to leverage these bene˛ts in the clinical setting. 
In vitro
 evidence of chloroquine/
HCQ on SARS-CoV-2
A majority of the putative antiviral e˚ects of chloroquine/HCQ 
molecules on the SARS-CoV-2 are the result of the indirect 
inferences drawn from the data available on SARS-CoV-1 or 
from an alternate viral model, that is, EpsteinŒBarr virus (EBV), 
HIV, and so forth. Led by its putative e˚ects on the endosomal 
function disruption in one of the earliest 
in vitro
 studies, 
the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) studied the e˚ects of 
chloroquine in primate Vero E6 cells (African green monkey 
kidney cells). The investigators found that chloroquine was 
e˚ective against SARS-CoV-1, and the inhibitory e˚ects were 
equally potent whether the primate cells were treated before 
or after exposure to the virus, suggesting both prophylactic 
and therapeutic applications. They further showed that 
addition of ammonium chloride to raise the endosomal pH 
also had a similar inhibitory e˚ect on the viral replication, 
suggesting that these e˚ects, that is, inhibition of cellular 
entry as well as postentry viral replication and assembly may 
be a˚ected by the alterations in the pH of the intracellular 
organelles.
17
In line with the ˛ndings from the CDC study, an investigative 
team in Wuhan, China, performed a similar 
in vitro
 time-of-
addition assay involving Vero E6 cells for SARS-Cov-2. In a 
physiology-based pharmacokinetic model, chloroquine/
HCQ concentrations in lung ˝uid were simulated under ˛ve 
di˚erent dosing regimens to explore the most potent and safe 
regimen. For ‚entry™ treatment, the drugs were added to the 
cells for 1 hour before viral attachment. For the ‚post-entry™ 
experiment, drugs were added at 2 hours post infection and 
maintained until the end of the experiment. Virus yield in 
the infected cell supernatants was quanti˛ed by quantitative 
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). 
Similar to the CDC experiments, the investigators found that 
these molecules a˚ected the control of virus at both entry and 
at post-entry stages.
28 The investigators further found that 
among the two, HCQ was more potent than chloroquine as 
the e˚ective concentration for a half-maximal response (EC
50) was much lower (0.72 ˇM) for HCQ than for chloroquine (5.47 
ˇM). Based on these experiments, the investigators suggested 
to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection with a loading dose of 400 mg 
twice daily of HCQ sulfate to be given orally on day 1, followed 
by 200 mg given twice daily for 4 more days. In another 
study from China,
29 the investigators found the EC
90 value of 
chloroquine against the SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells was 6.90 
ˇM. The investigators recommended that these concentrations, 
as evidenced through the pharmacokinetic studies for these 
molecules performed in the plasma of rheumatoid arthritis 
patients who received chloroquine at 500 mg per day dose, 
were clinically achievable.
30Clinical
 evidence of chloroquine/
HCQ on SARS-CoV-2
While the 
in vitro
 experiments provide a rationale for their use 
in COVID-19, there is limited evidence on the clinical e˜cacy of 
these compounds for treating COVID-19. At the time of writing 
this manuscript, we found there were over 50 randomized 
studies registered with clinicaltrials.gov for the use of HCQ in 
COVID-19. The vast majority were still in the pre-recruitment 
phase, and a few were in the early stages of recruitment, but 
none of the larger studies had published their results. The 
in vivo 
or clinical evidence presented in this review is derived mainly 
from the small-cohort, observational, and randomized studies 
(available for review at the time of manuscript preparation) on 
the clinical outcomes (Table 1).
In one of the ˛rst published pieces of evidence (published as 
a letter), Gao and colleagues from China drew attention to the 
potential role of chloroquine for treating COVID-19. Based on 
the clinical data collected from ten hospitals in China (Wuhan, 
Jingzhou, Guangzhou, Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, and 
Ningbo) involving >100 patients, the authors proposed that 
chloroquine was a promising therapeutic drug. They reported 
that the patients who received chloroquine phosphate had 
lower rates of pneumonia exacerbation, greater improvement 
in lung imaging ˛ndings, higher rates of conversion to the 
virus-negative state, and shorter disease course compared to 
those who did not receive the drug.
31 Unfortunately, the report 
did not publish speci˛c details about the patient population, 
response pattern, or analysis of outcomes. 
In another observational, single-arm, open-label clinical 
trial from Marseille, France,
32 the investigators reported 
clinical outcomes based on virological clearance from 
nasopharyngeal secretions. They enrolled 42 patients; over 
80% of patients either had no symptoms (16.7%) or had upper 
respiratory tract symptoms (61.1%). Only a minority (22.2%) 
had lower respiratory tract diseases, including bronchitis 
and pneumonia. The investigators compared this with a 
control untreated group (n=16) consisting of patients who 
were either treated at a nearby facility without HCQ or who 
refused participation. Twenty-six patients received HCQ (200 
mg three times daily for 10 days) of which six received it in 
conjunction with azithromycin (500 mg on day 1 followed by 
250 mg daily for 4 days). The inclusion of azithromycin was 
rationalized on the basis of its 
in vitro
 activity against Zika and 
Ebola viruses
33,34
 and on the clinical evidence for its ability 
to prevent severe respiratory tract infections in patients 
su˚ering from viral infection.
35 The primary outcome for the 
study was the virological clearance from nasopharyngeal 
secretions at day 6 after receiving the drug. The investigators 
found that patients treated with HCQ alone or in combination 
with azithromycin had signi˛cantly greater virological 
clearance (
p=0.001) at day 6 (57.1 and 100%, respectively), 
compared to those in the control group (12.5%). Although 
encouraging, this ongoing study, as published, had several

concerns to allow for strong recommendations in favor of or 
against HCQ. Six of the 26 patients in the treatment group 
were lost to follow-up and were not included in the analysis, 
with three transferred to intensive care unit (ICU), one death, 
and two withdrawals, limiting the interpretation of the 
data. Furthermore, the criteria for the selection of patients 
receiving additional azithromycin were not speci˛ed. Finally, 
the study had a very low proportion of patients with lower 
respiratory tract pathology, and outcomes of the clinical 
parameters including e˚ects on hemodynamic stability, 
ventilator parameters, length of ICU and hospital stay, and 
mortality have not been published. Nonetheless, early strong 
indications for the e˜cacy of this paper prompted another 
group in France to prospectively study 11 consecutive 
COVID-19 patients with high comorbidity burden (in 8 out 
of 11) admitted under their care to be treated with the 
combination regimen of HCQ and azithromycin, in doses 
similar to those used in the Marseille study. Serious adverse 
events (one death, two transfers to the ICU, and one drug 
discontinuation due to prolongation of QTc interval) were 
reported in 4 out of 11 patients, and 8 out of the remaining 
10 had persistently positive nasopharyngeal swab PCR after 
5Œ6 days of therapy, prompting investigators to conclude that 
there is no evidence of rapid clearance with this therapy.
36Findings from two additional randomized control studies 
recently became available for review. In the ˛rst one, 
investigators from Wuhan, China (Renmin Hospital of Wuhan 
University),
37
 evaluated the e˚ects of a 5-day course of HCQ 
(200 mg twice-a-day regimen) in addition to a ‚standard 
treatment™ comprising oxygen therapy, antibiotics, and 
immunoglobulin, with or without corticosteroids compared 
with ‚standard treatment™ alone. The study utilized clinical 
measures, such as the return of body temperature and

persistent improvement of cough symptoms lasting >72 
hours, as the primary outcomes. The results showed that 
the HCQ treatment group had a signi˛cantly shorter time to 
reach afebrile status (2.2±0.4 
versus
 3.2±1.3 days, 
p<0.0008) 
and had a signi˛cantly shorter time to cough relief (2.0±0.2 
versus
 3.1±1.5 days, 
p<0.0016) compared to the standard 
treatment group. The investigators also found that the rates of 
radiological improvements on chest computed tomography 
(CT) were higher in the HCQ treatment group (80.6%, 25 of 
31 patients) compared to the control group (54.8%, 17 of 31 
patients). While these ˛ndings are encouraging, another study 
from the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center in China
38 did 
not ˛nd similar bene˛ts with HCQ. In this study, 30 patients 
with con˛rmed COVIDŒ19 were randomized to either receive 
conventional treatment only or conventional treatment with 
the addition of HCQ (400 mg daily for 5 days). The investigators 
found that the viral clearance, as judged by the detection of 
the viral nucleic acid in the pharyngeal swab on day 7 after 
treatment initiation, was not di˚erent for the two groups. They 
also found that the di˚erence in the median time to achieve 
afebrile status and in the radiological ˛ndings of pneumonia 
was not di˚erent for the two groups.
Pharmacokinetics and safety 
concerns 
Details of the pharmacokinetics and safety pro˛les for 
chloroquine/HCQ were recently reviewed in this journal and 
are available.
1 We have more than seven decades of clinical 
experience with these agents, and overall, the safety of these 
agents is well established. HCQ is the structural analog of 
the chloroquine molecule with the addition of a ˘-hydroxyl 
moiety at one end. Although this imparts HCQ a comparable 
clinical e˜cacy, it has been noticed to do so by providing 
a better safety pro˛le.
1 In modern medicine, HCQ is a more 
commonly used formulation for most non-malarial indications. 
Both these agents are cheap, safe, and well tolerated by most 
patient populations, including pregnant women and those 
with chronic diseases or immunocompromised status. They are 
administered orally and have a near-complete absorption from 
the gastrointestinal tract with about 75% bioavailability.
39 Peak 
drug concentrations are achieved in about 4Œ12 hours after 
oral administration and are excreted principally through the 
kidneys, the process facilitated by acidi˛cation of the urine. 
Small quantities are also excreted through the bile, sweat, 
and saliva. They are widely distributed throughout the body, 
including the lung, 
40
 and have a large volume of distribution 
with signi˛cant intracellular sequestration, allowing them to 
have a long functional half-life (40Œ50 days) and achieve stable 
plasma levels usually after 4Œ6 weeks of regular daily dosing.
27 Unfortunately, these kinetics have been studied with chronic 
use of chloroquine/HCQ, and its applicability, especially in 
short courses, concerning alveolar concentration is not known.
The most frequent adverse e˚ects related to acute use 
comprise gastrointestinal intolerance, concerns for acute 
anemia Œ especially in patients with pre-existing glucose-6-
phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) de˛ciency, and ˝ashing 
lights as an acute manifestation of retinopathy. While the risk of 
retinopathy is a major limiting factor for chronic use at higher 
doses, this is likely to be less of a concern with acute short-term 
doses recommended for COVID-19, especially for HCQ that 
has a faster clearance from retinal pigment cells, compared 
to chloroquine.
41 Another concern particularly relevant to 
the current pandemic is the possibility of myocardial toxicity, 
QTc interval prolongation, and the possibility of cardiac 
arrhythmias. Several anecdotal reports and cohorts have raised 
concerns for chloroquine/HCQ -induced cardiomyopathy.
42 However, a detailed review of the data suggests that these 
concerns are signi˛cant largely in patients prescribed high 
doses of these agents.
43 Recent reports have also suggested 
that COVID-19 itself may cause myocardial injury, which 
in and of itself is associated with the higher incidence of 
adverse outcomes.
44
 It is noteworthy that the risk of adverse 
outcomes, and hence the need for therapy, is higher in the 
elderly COVID-19 population with multiple chronic diseases, the 
exact population at higher chances of having comorbidities or 
medications causing QTc prolongation. In this regard though, 
retrospective analyses of the rheumatological cohorts have 
shown that the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias is lower in 
patients on therapy with these agents compared to those 
not on treatment.
45 Although reassuring, these mutually 
contradictory data demand additional caution, as the doses of 
HCQ recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 are higher 
than those used conventionally for chronic low-dose therapy, 
and their interplay with direct toxicity of SARS-CoV-2 is not 
known. Thus, especially for the high-risk population with 
signi˛cant comorbidity burden, it may be prudent to obtain a 
routine electrocardiogram prior to initiating HCQ therapy. As 
azithromycin is also known to prolong the QTc interval, patients 
with prolonged QTc (i.e450Œ500 msec) may be better served 
by avoiding a combination regimen or with ongoing telemetry 
monitoring for the occurrence of arrhythmias.
Conclusions
The available data taken together show that chloroquine/
HCQ appears to have a potential role in the management of 
the clinical syndrome of the COVID-19. However, the level 
of preclinical and clinical evidence is not robust and must 
be backed by a higher level of data. Unfortunately, lack of 
alternative therapy, high rate of infectiousness and mortality, 
and the rapidity of spread elevate the nature of public 
health hazards related to COVID-19. The pandemic has many 
health and non-health rami˛cations, including the global 
recession. Thus, a rising number of regulatory healthcare 
agencies from across the globe, including China, Italy, 
France, Europe, Canada, and the USA Œ list not exhaustive, 
have included these compounds in their guidelines for 
treating COVIDŒ19.
46 At the same time, there are also over 
50 studies of varying enrollment targets, and a variety of

clinical, biological, and mortality-related outcome measures 
registered with the clinicaltrials.gov. Prominent among these 
are two major studies that aim to evaluate the e˚ect of these 
agents on therapy (WHO-sponsored pragmatic randomized 
study; Solidarity trial)
47 and the prophylaxis (National 
Instituteealth [NIH]-sponsored study evaluating the 
preventive aspects in the healthcare workers Œ Thealthcare 
Worker Exposure Response & Outcomes-HCQ [HERO-HCQ]).
48
 Pending the availability of such con˛rmatory studies, the use 
of these agents in COVID-19 should be viewed as experimental 
at this stage, and it should adhere to local, regional, or 
national ethics and research guidelines.
